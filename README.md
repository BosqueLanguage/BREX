# BREX
This project is a reimagining of regular language processing tools motivated by the needs of the Bosque Object Notation language ([BSQON](https://github.com/BosqueLanguage/BSQON)) project. This notation language makes heavy use of regular expressions for data description. Practical experience with regular expressions, and emperical results from academic reseaerch including [Regexes are Hard: Decision-making, Difficulties, and Risks in Programming Regular Expressions](https://davisjam.github.io//files/publications/MichaelDonohueDavisLeeServant-RegexesAreHard-ASE19.pdf) and [Exploring Regular Expression Usage and Contextin Python](https://kstolee.github.io/papers/ISSTA2016.pdf), has shown that classic PCRE style regular expressions languages have many maintainability, readability, and correctness issues. These challenges are particularly acute in the context of the BSQON project, where regular expressions are extensively used to describe and validate rich datatypes. Thus, the BREX regex language is designed to be a more maintainable, readable, and correct alternative to classic PCRE style regular expressions as well as support novel features of that are useful in the context of describe and validating data with a regular language.
